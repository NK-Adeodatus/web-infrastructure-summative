## Project Architecture

1. Web Servers
The project is cloned from GitHub and deployed on two web servers:

web-01

web-02

Both servers are configured to run the application using Nginx as the web server. Nginx handles the incoming requests and serves the content efficiently.

2. Load Balancer
A single load balancer, lb-01, is used to distribute user requests between the two servers (web-01 and web-02). This load balancing mechanism ensures that traffic is evenly distributed, optimizing server performance and increasing the application's reliability. If one server becomes unavailable, the other server will continue to handle requests, ensuring uptime.

3. IMDb API
The application integrates the IMDb Data API from RapidAPI, provided by OctopusTeam. This API allows access to a wide variety of IMDb data, including information on movies, TV shows, ratings, and more. The API is known for its lightning-fast performance, high reliability, and ease of integration.

API Overview:
Service: IMDb Data API

Provider: OctopusTeam

Purpose: Provides access to IMDb data, including movies, TV shows, ratings, and more.

Key Features:

High performance

Reliable

Easy integration with the project

4. Infrastructure Setup
The application was set up by following these steps:

Cloning the Project: The project repository was cloned from GitHub onto the two web servers (web-01 and web-02).

Hosting with Nginx: Both web servers are configured with Nginx to serve the application efficiently.

Load Balancer Setup: lb-01 load balancer was configured to evenly distribute incoming traffic between web-01 and web-02, ensuring optimal server performance and fault tolerance.

API Integration: The IMDb API is called to retrieve and display real-time data to users, ensuring the application is dynamic and up-to-date.

## Features

Real-time access to IMDb movie and TV show data

Load balancing across two web servers for improved performance and availability

Fast and reliable API integration from RapidAPI

## Setting Up The Project

To get the project up and running on your local machine or servers, follow the steps below:


1. Set Up Nginx on Web Servers
Install and configure Nginx on both web-01 and web-02.

Make sure Nginx is set up to serve the application files on both servers.

2. Set Up the Load Balancer
Configure the load balancer (lb-01) to distribute traffic evenly between web-01 and web-02.

3. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NK-Adeodatus/web-infrastructure-summative
   ```

4. API Configuration
Sign up for RapidAPI and get your API key for the IMDb Data API.

Replace the API key in the application's configuration files to enable API calls.

5. Start the Application
Once the setup is complete, start the application on both web servers, and the load balancer will begin handling incoming traffic.


## üîí Node.js Server for Secure API Integration
To securely fetch data from RapidAPI without exposing the API key to the frontend, a Node.js server is used as a proxy. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Frontend Request:

The frontend (api.js) sends a request to the Node.js server at /movies.
Node.js Server:

2. The Node.js server receives the request and forwards it to RapidAPI using the API key stored in a .env file.
The response from RapidAPI is sent back to the frontend.
3. Security:

The API key is never exposed to the frontend, ensuring secure communication with RapidAPI.
Node.js Server Code:
## üåê Nginx Configuration for Proxying Requests
Nginx is configured to act as a reverse proxy between the frontend and the Node.js server. This ensures that requests to /movies are routed to the Node.js server running on localhost:3000.

Nginx Configuration:
Add the following configuration to /etc/nginx/sites-available/default:
    location /movies {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

Steps to Configure Nginx:
1. Open the Nginx configuration file:
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

2. Add the above location /movies block under the appropriate server block.

3. Reload Nginx to apply the changes:
    sudo systemctl reload nginx


## Conclusion

This project leverages modern infrastructure and APIs to provide an interactive experience for users looking to explore IMDb data. The setup ensures high availability and scalability, providing a seamless user experience.
