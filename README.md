## Project Architecture

1. Web Servers
The project is cloned from GitHub and deployed on two web servers:

web-01

web-02

Both servers are configured to run the application using Nginx as the web server. Nginx handles the incoming requests and serves the content efficiently.

2. Load Balancer
A single load balancer, lb-01, is used to distribute user requests between the two servers (web-01 and web-02). This load balancing mechanism ensures that traffic is evenly distributed, optimizing server performance and increasing the application's reliability. If one server becomes unavailable, the other server will continue to handle requests, ensuring uptime.

3. IMDb API
The application integrates the IMDb Data API from RapidAPI, provided by OctopusTeam. This API allows access to a wide variety of IMDb data, including information on movies, TV shows, ratings, and more. The API is known for its lightning-fast performance, high reliability, and ease of integration.

API Overview:
Service: IMDb Data API

Provider: OctopusTeam

Purpose: Provides access to IMDb data, including movies, TV shows, ratings, and more.

Key Features:

High performance

Reliable

Easy integration with the project

4. Infrastructure Setup
The application was set up by following these steps:

Cloning the Project: The project repository was cloned from GitHub onto the two web servers (web-01 and web-02).

Hosting with Nginx: Both web servers are configured with Nginx to serve the application efficiently.

Load Balancer Setup: lb-01 load balancer was configured to evenly distribute incoming traffic between web-01 and web-02, ensuring optimal server performance and fault tolerance.

API Integration: The IMDb API is called to retrieve and display real-time data to users, ensuring the application is dynamic and up-to-date.

## Features

Real-time access to IMDb movie and TV show data

Load balancing across two web servers for improved performance and availability

Fast and reliable API integration from RapidAPI

## Setting Up The Project

Steps to Get the project up and running on the servers, follow the steps below:


1. Set Up Nginx on Web Servers
Install and configure Nginx on both web-01 and web-02.

Make sure Nginx is set up to serve the application files on both servers.

2. Set Up the Load Balancer
Configure the load balancer (lb-01) to distribute traffic evenly between web-01 and web-02.

3. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NK-Adeodatus/web-infrastructure-summative
   ```

4. Start the Application
Once the files of the are in the /var/www/html directory the servers start hosting the website, and the load balancer will begin handling incoming traffic.

## Conclusion

This project leverages modern infrastructure and APIs to provide an interactive experience for users looking to explore IMDb data. The setup ensures high availability and scalability, providing a seamless user experience.
